## Pure render.

# Purpose
The purpose is to start learn C++. I have 'some' experience with Java, Python and now I want to expand scope of my skills and knowlage. Probably nobody will read this readme ever, but this approach (take a project and make it) works best. When you are doing something you are learning and using new conceptions, using particular language. The point of it, that you WILL forget pure theory but you won't forget the conceptions and principles. Human memory bad at storing theory without
experience with using this theory.
