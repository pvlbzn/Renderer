# Purpose
The purpose is to start learn C++. I have 'some' experience with Java, Python
and now I want to expand scope of my skills and knowledge. Probably nobody will
read this readme ever, but this approach (take a project and make it) works
best. When you are doing something you are learning and using new conceptions,
using particular language(tool). The point of it, that you will forget theory
but you won't forget the conceptions and principles. Human memory bad at storing
theory, however it's quite OK with holding a conceptions and experience.
